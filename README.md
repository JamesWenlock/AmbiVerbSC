# AmbiVerbSC

The AmbiVerbSC is a tank reverb quark with coupling. It was creating in collaboration  with Center for Digital Arts and Experimental Media at the University of Washington under Dr.Joseph Anderson.  

### Prerequisites   
* the [Ambsionic Toolkit](http://www.ambisonictoolkit.net/download/supercollider/) with [kernels](http://www.ambisonictoolkit.net/download/kernels/)
* [SuperCollider 3.8.0](http://supercollider.github.io/download.html)

    
### Installing

AmbiVerbSC can be installed using the Quarks gui in supercollier.
*  Here's some more information on quarks and how to use them --> [Quarks Help](http://doc.sccode.org/Guides/UsingQuarks.html)

## Getting Started

To use the AmbiVerbSC GUI, run the following code - 

AmbiVerbGUI(s);

A description of AmbiVerbSC's inner workings can be found on the AmbiVerbSC tutorial page in the help browser. Parameter details can be found in the class help file.

## Acknowledgments

* This project would not have been possible without the guidence, generosity and support University of Washington's Digital Arts deparment.
* I would like to personally thank
    * **Dr.Joseph Anderson** for taking me on this quater. Acting as my mentor this quater, he taught me everything I know now about ambisonics, as well as a bunch of other things! He's absolutely brilliant and I'm so grateful for all the time, flexibility, resources and expertise. This project would not have happened without him!
    * **Dan Peterson** for all the help! He's debugged my code, helped me develop new techniques, as well as be a fantastic teacher throughout my sonic studies. This project would not have happened without him!
    * **Dr.Juan Pampin** for meeting with me throughtout the year, creating an incredible for education, and helping me reach my rather ambitious goals. Thanks so much for the incredible resources and opportunities  
    * **Dr.Ewa Trębacz** for getting me started in the labs and helping me get the resources needed to execute this project. I appreciate the time and thought!
